about=This plugin uses a SQLite database to create a full-text-search trigram Index of all attributes of all loaded layers within a QGIS project. Any change applied to these layers can be tracked by the plugin automatically and the full-text-search index is updated accordingly. The user then can use a single text-input field to search for any value present within the attributes.
